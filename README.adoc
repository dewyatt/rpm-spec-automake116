image:https://img.shields.io/travis/riboseinc/rpm-spec-automake116/master.svg[Build Status (Travis CI), link=https://travis-ci.org/riboseinc/rpm-spec-automake116]

== Introduction

This repository hosts the RPM spec & related Docker files for building the RPM
package.

It uses code from https://github.com/riboseinc/rpm-specs[`rpm-specs`]
(added as a Git submodule).

== Usage

This is an https://www.softwarecollections.org[`SCL package`] and has specific
requirements on usage.

To ensure the installation has gone well, a quick check on the version should
suffice:

```sh
scl enable ribose-automake116 -- automake --version
```

For some uses, you will also want to set or extend `ACLOCAL_PATH`.
For example, when running `autoreconf` for software that requires an m4
from a system package (such as gettext-devel), you might use:

```sh
source /opt/ribose/ribose-automake116/enable
env ACLOCAL_PATH=/usr/share/aclocal autoreconf -vfi
```

Or:

```sh
scl enable ribose-automake116 -- env ACLOCAL_PATH=/usr/share/aclocal autoreconf -vfi
```
